             This constructor initializes the Brobizz discount and the date when a Car or MC object is created.
             It also takes the Price() from each vehicle class and uses it to calculate the discounted price to be paid,
             which becomes the TicketPrice.

            It must only be 7 characters long,

            Checks if the user is a Brobizz user then
            calculates the the price to be paid accordingly.
            BasePrice is the price of each vehicle that is set in the corresponding classes.
            Made this a virtual method so it can be overrided in the Car class to implement the
            weekend discount.
